### How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?

How to download the memories? One of the options is to scan the brain, but our current IRM machines are by far not powerful enough to accomplish a task of this magnitude. There is another option 
that seems possible, cutting our brain in small slices and then use a high detail microscope and use like a printer scanner to map our brain memories. In 2019 scientist used this technique to 
succesfully map a cube on 1 millimeter of mouse brain.
This cube was cut in about 25 000 thousand slices, it runt for about 5 months and produced more than 100 millions images. For creating a 3d model of this brain they needed 3 months for this, and the 
models was about 2 million gigaoctecs.
Or the humane brain is about 1 millions tymes bigger so we would need 2 Million Petabytes of storage. The equivalent of 2097152000000 Gb of storage. For comparison the entire internet is about 22 
Millions Petabytes.
2097152000000 / 4
524288000000
We would need 524288000000 4 Gb USB stick to store one human brain.
